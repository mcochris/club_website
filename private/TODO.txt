Add logout function.

DONE - Add logins to logins DB table

Add visits to visits DB table

FIXED - If user navigates to chrisstrawser.com/index.html/?token=kjjsflk (any token), css stops loading (note / after index.html, w/o slash, all ok)

members.php may return false if user is not logged in, need to handle return value in index.ts

FIXED - if the email token is invalid, is_email_token_valid.php returns false, but screen is blank. screen should show email entry dialog

if user is logged in and cookie if cleared (or they log out before the email token expires), site may say "you have an outstanding login link..."
